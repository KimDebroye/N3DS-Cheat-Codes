**************************************************

General Notes:
  * In order for enabled cheat codes to take effect,
    depending on the code enabled, some codes require you to:
    * Use a button combination.
      * These codes are marked with a * and
	    list the button combination to be used between (parentheses).
    * Trigger a screen transition.
	  Accomplishable by, for example:
        * Switching between worlds on World Map
		  (if more then one world opened).
	    * Entering and exiting a level.
	      * Some codes require this because of checks used in the code.
	      * For exiting a level,
		    any of the following options are valid:
	        * Die in level.
	        * Pause and return to map.
	        * Finish a level.
  * All cheat codes can be used in all levels (including Browser Castle).
