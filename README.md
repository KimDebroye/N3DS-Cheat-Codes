## Installation
- Running **Custom Firmware Luma3DS 9.1 or higher**:
  - Insert the SD/MicroSD card into your computer/phone.
    - *You can also use FTP if you are familiar with that.*
  - Create a folder named `cheats` on the root of your SD/MicroSD card (if it doesn't already exist).
  - Place the .txt file(s) containing the cheats for your game region in this folder.
    - For **New Super Mario Bros 2 - Special Edition (Europe)**:
      - *SD/MicroSD card root*/`cheats`/**0004000000137F00.txt**
    - For **New Super Mario Bros 2 - Gold Edition (USA)**:
      - *SD/MicroSD card root*/`cheats`/**0004000000137E00.txt**
  - When transfered, eject/unmount the SD/MicroSD card from your computer/phone.
    - *Or disconnect the FTP connection.*
  - Launch the game and pull up the Rosalina menu (`L+Down+Select`).
  - Select the menu option "Cheats".
  - Select the cheats you want to activate by pressing the A button.
    - Certain cheats need additional key combinations when in game. These cheats are marked with a * and also mention the key combinations to use in order to activate the cheat at any given time when in game.
  - Exit out of the Rosalina menu by pressing the B button until the game is back in focus.
- Happy cheating!

  - New 2DS/3DS XL
    - Could be compatible with Old 2DS/3DS, although I don't own one of those and thus couldn't test.
  - Custom Firmware
    - Luma3DS 10.0.1
    - Luma3DS 9.1
    
**************************************************

## Bugs/Issues
- From time to time, I still had a crash at seemingly random moments when too many cheats where activated at the same time.
- I did iron out most of the crashes though.

## General Notes
- I did this out of pure fun and interest to find out about how a cheating process works, not necessarily to play a game.
Learned quite a lot in the process, although I'm still not up to par with the best.
- I searched/created all codes by myself, except for:
  - Instant Powerup Change codes: merged and edited codes from [cheat contributor Optantic](https://www.max-cheats.com/view.php?ItemID=196) (or maybe even someone else).
  - Midair Jump: ported the USA region cheat code from the [CTRPF Cheat Code Database](https://github.com/JourneyOver/CTRPF-AR-CHEAT-CODES/blob/master/Cheats/New%20Super%20Mario%20Bros.%202%20(Gold%20Edition)%20(USA)/0004000000137E00.txt) to European region.
- All codes I searched/created are RAM based (so no ASM codes).
-  I added my notes to this repository for those interested in reading about [my findings and thought process](https://github.com/KimDebroye/N3DS-Cheat-Codes/blob/master/_Findings%20%26%20Thoughts/(NSMB2%20-%20SE%2BGE)%20Findings%20%26%20Thoughts.txt). It's not very well structured though (I didn't intend it for public reading, was fine for me though to work with) and also has a few Dutch language strings, which can of course easily be translated using Google Translate for example in case needed.
