- Running **Custom Firmware Luma3DS 9.1 or higher**:
  - Insert the SD/MicroSD card into your computer/phone.
    - *You can also use FTP if you are familiar with that.*
  - Create a folder named `cheats` on the root of your SD/MicroSD card (if it doesn't already exist).
  - Place the .txt file(s) containing the cheats for your game region in this folder.
    - For **New Super Mario Bros 2 - Special Edition (Europe)**:
      - *SD/MicroSD card root*/`cheats`/**0004000000137F00.txt**

    - *Or disconnect the FTP connection.*
  - Launch the game and pull up the Rosalina menu (`L+Down+Select`).
  - Select the menu option "Cheats".
  - Select the cheats you want to activate by pressing the A button.
    - Certain cheats need additional key combinations when in game. These cheats are marked with a * and also mention the key combinations to use in order to activate the cheat at any given time when in game.
  - Exit out of the Rosalina menu by pressing the B button until the game is back in focus.
- Happy cheating!

## Bugs/Issues/Feedback
- Although the codes work fine and I tried to iron out most crashes,
I did encounter some seemingly random crashes depending on cheats used/circumstances.
- Should you have feedback, feel free to drop a comment in [the GBAtemp release thread](https://gbatemp.net/threads/release-new-super-mario-bros-2-gold-special-edition-cheat-codes.550034/).

## Credits, Software/Tools Used & Technical Notes
- [CTRPluginFramework (by Nanquitas)](https://github.com/Nanquitas/CTRPluginFramework-BlankTemplate)
- [TempAR](https://raing3.gshi.org/files/psp/tools/pointer_searcher.zip)
- [Gateway RAM Tools](https://www.maxconsole.com/threads/tool-gateway-ram-tools.40776/)
- [HxD: Freeware Hex Editor](https://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/)
- I searched/created all codes myself using the above software/tools and RAM Dump comparisons (so no ASM codes), except for:
  - Instant Powerup Change codes: merged and edited codes from [cheat contributor Optantic](https://www.max-cheats.com/view.php?ItemID=206) (or maybe even someone else).
  - Midair Jump: ported the USA region cheat code from the [CTRPF Cheat Code Database](https://github.com/JourneyOver/CTRPF-AR-CHEAT-CODES/blob/master/Cheats/New%20Super%20Mario%20Bros.%202%20(Gold%20Edition)%20(USA)/0004000000137E00.txt) to European region.
  - Rapid Fireballs
- I added my notes to this repository for those interested in reading about [my findings and thought process](https://github.com/KimDebroye/N3DS-Cheat-Codes/blob/master/_Findings%20%26%20Thoughts/(NSMB2%20-%20SE%2BGE)%20Findings%20%26%20Thoughts.txt). It's not very well structured though (I didn't intend it for public reading, was fine for me though to work with) and also has a few Dutch language strings, which can of course easily be translated using Google Translate for example in case needed.

## General Notes
- I did this out of pure fun and interest to find out about how a cheating process works, not necessarily to play a game.
Learned quite a lot in the process. I'm still not up to par with the best, though.
