## General Notes:
  - In order for enabled cheat codes to take effect, depending on the code enabled, <br />**some codes require you to:**
    - **Use a button combination.**
      - *These codes are marked with a * and list the button combination to be used between (parentheses).*
    - **Switch Screens.** Accomplishable by, for example:
      - *Switching between Worlds on World Map (if more then one World opened).*
      - *Entering and exiting a level.*
	- *Some codes require this because of checks used in the code.*
	- *For exiting a level, any of the following options are valid:*
	  - *Die in level.*
	  - *Pause and return to map.*
	  - *Finish a level.*
  - All codes can be used in all levels (including Browser Castle).

**************************************************

  - Insert the SD/MicroSD card into your computer/phone.
    - *You can also use FTP if you are familiar with that.*
  - Create a folder named `cheats` on the root of your SD/MicroSD card (if it doesn't already exist).
  - Place/Overwrite the .txt file(s) containing the cheats for your game region in this folder.
    - For **New Super Mario Bros 2 - Special Edition (Europe)**:
      - *SD/MicroSD card root*/`cheats`/**0004000000137F00.txt**

    - Certain cheats need additional key combinations when in game. These cheats are marked with a * and also mention the key combinations to use in order to activate the cheat at any given time when in game.
  - Exit out of the Rosalina menu by pressing the B button until the game is back in focus.
- Happy cheating!

## Cheat Compatibility
- Compatible with
  - New 2DS/3DS XL
    - Could be compatible with Old 2DS/3DS, although I don't own one of those and thus couldn't test.
  - Custom Firmware
    - Luma3DS 10.0.1
    - Luma3DS 9.1
    
**************************************************

## Bugs/Issues/Feedback
- Although the codes work fine and I tried to iron out most crashes,
I did encounter some seemingly random crashes depending on cheats used/circumstances.
  - A good advice is to occasionally turn off cheats you don't need all the time (like f.e. set & reset cheats, ...)
- Should you have feedback, feel free to drop a comment in [the GBAtemp release thread](https://gbatemp.net/threads/release-new-super-mario-bros-2-gold-special-edition-cheat-codes.550034/).

It's not very well structured though (I didn't intend it for public reading, was fine for me though to work with) and contains a few Dutch language strings, which can of course easily be translated using Google Translate for example in case needed.

## Personal Notes
I did this out of pure fun and interest to find out about how a cheating process works, not necessarily to play a game.
Learned quite a lot in the process.
