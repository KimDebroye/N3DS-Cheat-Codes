- Running **Custom Firmware Luma3DS 9.1 or higher**:
  - Insert the SD/MicroSD card into your computer/phone.
    - *You can also use FTP if you are familiar with that.*
  - Create a folder named `cheats` on the root of your SD/MicroSD card (if it doesn't already exist).
  - Place the .txt file(s) containing the cheats for your game region in this folder.
    - For **New Super Mario Bros 2 - Special Edition (Europe)**:
      - *SD/MicroSD card root*/`cheats`/**0004000000137F00.txt**

  - Launch the game and pull up the Rosalina menu (`L+Down+Select`).
  - Select the menu option "Cheats".
  - Select the cheats you want to activate by pressing the A button.
    - Certain cheats need additional key combinations when in game. These cheats are marked with a * and also mention the key combinations to use in order to activate the cheat at any given time when in game.
  - Exit out of the Rosalina menu by pressing the B button until the game is back in focus.
- Happy cheating!

- Although the codes work fine and I tried to iron out most crashes,
I did encounter some seemingly random crashes depending on cheats used/circumstances.

It's not very well structured though (I didn't intend it for public reading, was fine for me though to work with) and also has a few Dutch language strings, which can of course easily be translated using Google Translate for example in case needed.

## General Notes
- I did this out of pure fun and interest to find out about how a cheating process works, not necessarily to play a game.
Learned quite a lot in the process. I'm still not up to par with the best, though.
